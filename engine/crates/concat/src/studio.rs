//! The window's state, and how it is published into Slint.
//!
//! Two kinds of state live here and the line between them is the whole
//! design:
//!
//! - **The edit** is the engine's. It lives in the open [`Session`], every
//!   change to it is a [`Command`], and this module only ever reads it back.
//!   A gesture in flight is previewed on an *echo* - a clone of the project
//!   the pointer mutates - and committed as one command on release, so undo
//!   undoes the drag and not a pixel of it.
//! - **The view** is the window's: selection, playhead, zoom, tool, the
//!   workspace's arrangement, which lanes are locked, what the dialogs show.
//!   None of it reaches the document.
//!
//! Everything Slint draws is produced by `publish` and its two halves from
//! those two, on every event that could have changed either.
