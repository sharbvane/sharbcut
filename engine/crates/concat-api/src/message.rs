//! What crosses the API boundary: a [`Request`] in, a [`Response`] out,
//! and [`Event`]s along the way.
//!
//! All three are serde types with a fixed JSON shape, and that shape is the
//! contract: a transport is free to carry it over stdin, a socket or a
//! function call, but never to reinterpret it. Requests are tagged by
//! `method`, events by `event`, and a response is `{"result": ...}` or
//! `{"error": "..."}`. Fields are camelCase, matching the document and the
//! command layer, so a caller learns one spelling.
//!
//! The edit vocabulary is not redefined here. [`Request::EditApply`] carries
//! a `concat_project` [`Command`] as it is, so every operation the window
//! can perform is one an API caller can perform, with the same clamps and
//! the same refusals, and a new command needs nothing added here.
