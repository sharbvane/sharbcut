//! Titles as pixels.
//!
//! A text clip is a style and some words; the compositor wants a picture. This
//! crate is the step between: it finds the face, shapes each line, turns the
//! glyph outlines into paths, and paints them - plate, shadow, outline, fill -
//! onto a canvas the size of the output frame, transparent everywhere the
//! words are not.
//!
//! Frame-sized on purpose. The compositor places a picture by fitting it into
//! the frame and then applying the clip's transform about its centre, so a
//! canvas that *is* the frame fits at exactly one, decodes without resampling,
//! and puts the canvas's centre where the clip's centre is. The clip's offset
//! and rotation then mean the same thing for a title as for footage.
//!
//! Where the block sits on that canvas is the alignment's to say. A centred
//! title has its block centred, so the clip's position is the block's middle.
//! A left-aligned one has its block's left edge on the canvas's centre, a
//! right-aligned one its right edge: the position is the edge the words are
//! aligned to, and typing more grows the block *away* from that edge rather
//! than out from the middle - which is what left and right mean everywhere
//! else, and what a title that keeps its left margin while its words change
//! needs. [`Rendered`] reports where the block landed so a monitor can draw
//! its outline there.
//!
//! Sizes in the style are fractions of the frame's height, as the document
//! stores them, so a title looks the same at 720p and 4K. Everything here
//! converts to pixels once, at the top.
