//! What the editor window needs that is not the edit itself.
//!
//! The edit lives in `concat-project`, pixels in `concat-render` and
//! `concat-export`, files in `concat-media`. This crate is the layer the
//! window talks to: it opens a project folder as a [`session::Session`],
//! keeps the recents list, caches waveforms and filmstrips beside the
//! project, composites the paused monitor's true frame, plays the audible
//! clips, finds the masks behind cutouts, packs templates, and holds the
//! one-at-a-time slots for long jobs.
//!
//! The window calls these functions in-process, and the doctrine is that
//! no editing decision is made here. If a function starts deciding what an
//! edit means, it belongs in `concat-project`.
//!
//! Nothing here knows about a window. Long work reports through callbacks
//! and cancels through flags, and the caller decides which thread it runs on.
